# EXERCISE 1: Rebuild your Rshiny model using PKPDsim

## Model components

Running a simulation requires THREE arguments: <br>
  1. Model <br>
  2. Parameters <br>
  3. Regimen <br>

## 1. Model


```{r}

# The PKPDsim library has pre-packaged models. 
# They can be viewed by running new_ode_model() with an empty bracket. 
# You can deploy them by saving to a variable:

# i.e. my_model <- new_ode_model("pk_1cmt_oral")

# Here we will hard code the model for a 2cmt oral model. 
# In your courses, you will learn to write out your own ordinary differential equations (ODE).

my_model <- new_ode_model(code = "
      dAdt[1] = -KA*A[1]
      dAdt[2] = KA*A[1] - CL/V*A[2] - Q/V*A[2] + Q/V2*A[3]
      dAdt[3] = Q/V*A[2] - Q/V2*A[3]
      CP = A[2]/V
      ",
      obs = list(cmt = 2, scale = "V"),
      declare_variables = c("CP"))

# run "my_model" to see the model summary and required parameters

my_model

```

## 2. Parameters

```{r}
# Input your PK parameters you derived from the Rshiny app here:

V = 500 # Central volume (L)
CL = 25 # Clearance (L/h)
KA = 1 # Rate of absorption (1/h)
Q = 10 # Intercompartmental clearance (L/h)
V2 = 1000 # Peripheral volume (L)

# We'll store these in a list that PKPDsim can read
my_parameters <- list("V"  = V,
                      "CL" = CL,
                      "KA" = KA,
                      "Q"  = Q,
                      "V2" = V2
                      )
  
```

## 3. Regimen

```{r}
# One single dose of 300 mg at time 0
# Look up ?new_regimen to see arguments this function takes

my_regimen <- new_regimen(amt=300, time=0) 

```

## Simulate!

Put it all together <br>
Use sim() to create a dataset of simulation


```{r}
# fill in the three arguments with our three components from above
my_simulated_df <- sim(ode = my_model,
                       regimen = my_regimen,
                       parameters = my_parameters,
                       only_obs = T,
                       output_include = list(variables=T)
                       )
# Open your new dataset and understand the set up. 
# What is each column? What are the units of each column?
```

## Plot

```{r}
# use ggplot to plot the data (feel free to copy and paste from yesterday's workshop)

ggplot(my_simulated_df, mapping=aes(x=t,y=y))+
  geom_line()

# does your plot look similar to your model in the Rshiny app?

```
```{r}

# challenge: can you add the 300 mg dose data from simtab.csv to this plot?

data <- read.csv("simtab.csv") %>%
  filter(DOSE==300)

ggplot(my_simulated_df, mapping=aes(x=t,y=y))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(data, mapping=aes(x=TIME,y=DV))


```



# EXERCISE 2: Simulate alternate scenarios

Now that we have a model, we can use it to simulate alternate scenarios. <br>

Make a new regimen with new_regimen() and change the amt and time to change the dose and frequency. <br>

## Efficacy and Toxicity Thresholds
Can you find a regimen that keeps you in a therapeutic window that stays below the level of toxicity and above the level of efficacy? <br>
```{r}

tox_threshold <- 2.7 #mg/L
eff_threshold <- 1.1 #mg/L

```

## New Regimens

```{r}
# Create a new regimen
# Look up ?new_regimen to see what arguments this function takes

# HINT: for multiple dosing, you will need a vector of times.
# A vector can be created using c(). 
## ex. c(0,24,48,72)

# Another way is to use seq(). 
## ex. seq(start_time, end_time, increment)

my_regimen <- new_regimen(amt=600, time=seq(0,28*24,12)) 

```

## Simulate new regimen

```{r}
# fill in the three arguments with our three components from above
my_simulated_df <- sim(ode = my_model,
                       regimen = my_regimen,
                       parameters = my_parameters,
                       only_obs = T,
                       output_include = list(variables=T),
                       t_obs = seq(0,31*24,0.1)
                       )
```

## Plot your simulation

```{r}
# use ggplot to plot the data 
# use geom_hline to add lines for your efficacy and toxicity thresholds

ggplot(my_simulated_df, mapping=aes(x=t,y=y))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = tox_threshold)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = eff_threshold)+
  ylab("Concentration (mg/L)")+
  xlab("Time (hr)")+
  theme_bw()

# does your plot look similar to your model in the Rshiny app?
```

# Additional exploration

```{r}
# How does the plot change with increased frequency?
# How does the plot change with increased dose?
```
